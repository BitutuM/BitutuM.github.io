Hey there! I'm Mercy Mogambi, a passionate GIS Analyst with hands-on experience in:

- Geospatial data analysis  
- Surveying and mapping  
- Image annotation and segmentation for machine learning  
- Virtual staging and design  

I thrive in both technical and creative environments, from using ArcGIS and AutoCAD Civil 3D in the field, to annotating social media content for AI training.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Geomatic Engineering and Geospatial Information Systems from JKUAT, Kenya.  
I'm currently working as a **Sponsorship Analyst** at Relo Metrics.
